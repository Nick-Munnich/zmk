ZMK, being built on [Zephyr™](https://zephyrproject.org/), is very modular and flexible. This allows users to combine features, flags, and properties to "construct" features in ZMK, without the need to modify the underlying source code.

However, this very same flexibility can be difficult to utilise, thanks to the resulting complexity. This section features guides and informative pages on how to integrate configure, and modify hardware with ZMK; **without** needing to refer to [Zephyr™ documentation](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/3.5.0/index.html) for a majority of cases.
